# Exercise #1
Start with [this code](https://play.golang.org/p/3W69TH4nON). Instead of using the blank identifier, make sure the code is checking and handling the error.

# Exercise #2
Start with [this code](https://play.golang.org/p/9a1IAWy5E6). Create a custom error message using “fmt.Errorf”.

# Exercise #3
Create a struct “customErr” which implements the builtin.error interface. Create a func “foo” that has a value of type error as a parameter. Create a value of type “customErr” and pass it into “foo”. If you need a hint, [here is one](https://play.golang.org/p/L5QWV8-p11).

# Exercise #4
Starting with [this code](https://play.golang.org/p/wlEM1tgfQD), use the sqrt.Error struct as a value of type error. If you would like, use these numbers for your
lat "50.2289 N"
long "99.4656 W"

# Exercise #5
We are going to make exercises about testing next. For this exercise, take a moment and see how much you can figure out about testing by reading the [testing documentation](https://godoc.org/testing) & also [Caleb Doxsey’s article on testing](http://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/12). See if you can get a basic example of testing working.
